    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: 3D Terrain Generator</h3>
    <h4>09/10/20</h4>
    <p>
      My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
      City (2020). It is in the "Calm my nerves" theme. This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
      of the use of loops, arrays, randomization and working with 3D objects.
      I created a randomized 3D terrain generator.
    </p>
    <p>
      This generator creates new landscapes using the coordinates of vertices which make up
      2D strips of triangles which make up a gridlike surface. By rotating them and modifiying the 
      Z positions of these vertices I was able to raise and lower certain points to give 
      the effect of hilly or mountainous terrain. In order to avoid gaps in flat layer I stored
      these coordinates in a 2D array so that it would be easier for each strip to connect
      with a shared side of coordinates.
    </p>
    <p>
      I simulated a day light cycle by playing with lighting methods, more specifically
      <b>directionalLight()</b> which allowed me to control the position and hue of the light.
      Using a sin() calculation I was able to get the light to smoothly bob above and below 
      the surface of the planes which increased and decreased the light level. This also meant
      that I wouldn't have to keep the polygon outlines visible as the shadows created by the
      light showed depth.
    </p>
