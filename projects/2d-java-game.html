		<h2>2D Java Game: The Dungeon</h2>

			As part of my course's first year programming module, I developed a 2D game using Java.
			The Game itself resembled an arcade-style dungeon crawler with the gameplay mechanics and 
			assests taken from <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/101424916/">a game</a>
			I made in Scratch for a school project some years ago.
		</p>
		<p>
			The project was developed using a wrapper library (CityEngine) for JBox2D which was provided by the university.
			This served as a physics engine that helped me set up a 2D environment and create objects that moved and 
			interacted with eachother in accordance to the laws of physics.

		<p>
			I initially focussed on showcasing my applications of inheritence and polymorphism among classes.
			This involved extending functionality of classes in the physics engine to better suit my implementation.
			All the enemies and their behaviour in the game are extensions of the Monster class which I created by 
			extending the engine's Walker class.<br>
			Other notable features include text file handeling to keep track of high scores as well as working with
			different GUI layouts using the Swing library.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, I payed less attention to my project's structure during early development. Having now gained a better
			appreciation of <i>low coupling</i> and <i>cohesion</i> between classes, on reflection I could've avoided
			using global variables and kept better track of where certain functions were carried out. This would have 
			also simplified the process of bug finding and fixing.<br>
			The project may also have benefited from more controller classes and interfaces to help organise class
			associations as well as collection classes to manage enemies on each level instead of having to create multiple
			timers to check if an enemy needed to dissapear from view.
		</p>

		<p>
			In conclusion, working on this project gave me a valuable insight into object orienatated programming.
			I also became comfortable with coding in Java and had good introduction to creating graphical user interfaces
			in Swing.
			This has been one of my first projects where I've used version control software (Git) to track my progress
			and document development.
