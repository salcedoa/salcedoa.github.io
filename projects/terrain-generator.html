          My first programming project, concluding the 2-week Programming Bootcamp at 
          City (2020). It is in the 3D Graphics theme. This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
          of the use of loops, arrays, randomization and working with 3D graphics.
          I created a randomized 3D terrain generator.

        <p>
          This generator creates new landscapes using the coordinates of vertices which make up
          2D strips of triangles which form a grid-like 2D surface. By rotating this surface and 
          modifying the Z positions of the vertices, I was able to raise and lower certain points
          to give the effect of hilly or mountainous terrain. To avoid gaps between the strips, 
          I stored these coordinates in a 2D array so that it would be easier to pair neighboring strips
          with a shared side of coordinates.

          I simulated a day-night cycle by playing with lighting methods, more specifically
          <b>directionalLight()</b> which allowed me to control the position and hue of the light.
          Using a sin wave calculation, I was able to get the light to smoothly bob above and below 
          the surface of the planes which increased and decreased the light level. This also meant
          that I wouldn't have to keep the polygon outlines visible as the shadows created by the
          light showed depth.

          Overall, I learnt a lot about working with 3D graphics and Processing. This was the first 
          programming project where I created and used Class objects. I've wanted to create a terrain
          generator for quite a while now and had done some related research for my IB Maths internal
          assessment last year.
