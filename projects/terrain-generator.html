        <p>During a 2-week programming bootcamp at university, I developed a 3D terrain generator using <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>, a language similar to Java with out-of-the-box graphics support. This project served as an introduction to working with 3D graphics, classes, 2D arrays, and randomization.</p>
        
        <p>The terrain generator constructs randomized landscapes by manipulating vertex coordinates to form 2D strips of triangles. These strips are combined to create a grid-like 3D surface. By adjusting the Z positions of the vertices, I simulated hilly and mountainous terrain. To ensure continuity between the strips, I used a 2D array to manage the vertex coordinates, facilitating the pairing of neighboring strips.</p>

        <p>To highlight the terrain's depth, I added a <a href="https://processing.org/reference/directionalLight_.html">directional light</a> to the scene which created shadows across the terrain. Using a sine wave calculation, the position of this new light source could be smoothly shifted up and down the y-axis. In this way, a day-night cycle was simulated.</p>

        <p>The program consists of two instances of the <i>plane</i> class: <i>land</i> and <i>water</i>. With <i>land</i> having noisier terrain and dynamic colour changes while the <i>water</i> instance is much flatter. This project marked my first experience creating and using class objects, which enhanced my understanding of object-oriented design.</p>

        <p>My interest in terrain generation, which I had previously explored during my IB Maths internal assessment, provided a solid foundation for this work. The complete code for this project is available on <a href="https://github.com/salcedoa/adbs952/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
